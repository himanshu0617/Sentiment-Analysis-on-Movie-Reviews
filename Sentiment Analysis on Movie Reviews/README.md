# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. It is suitable for showcasing on GitHub, in a resume, or for internship submissions.

## Features
- Uses a built-in sample dataset for quick demonstration and testing
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, stopword removal)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization (line, bar, scatter plots)
- Model training and evaluation (Naive Bayes, easily extendable)
- Prediction on new/unseen reviews

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository** and open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. **Run all cells** in `sentiment_analysis_movie_reviews.ipynb` to preprocess, train, evaluate, and predict. No external dataset is required.
3. **Review the summary** at the end for project highlights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
- The notebook uses a small, built-in sample dataset of movie reviews for demonstration purposes.
- You can easily modify the notebook to use a larger real-world dataset (such as the [IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)) by updating the data loading cell.
