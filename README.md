# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning and data analytics pipeline for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. It is suitable for showcasing on GitHub, in a resume, or for company/internship submissions.

## Features
- Uses the real-world IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset (aclImdb)
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, stopword removal)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization (line, bar, scatter plots)
- Model training and evaluation (Naive Bayes, easily extendable)
- Prediction on new/unseen reviews

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository** and ensure the `aclImdb` folder is present in the project directory (train/test data included).
2. **Run all cells** in `sentiment_analysis_movie_reviews.ipynb` to preprocess, train, evaluate, and predict using the real IMDB dataset.
3. **Review the summary** at the end for project highlights and results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
- The project uses the [IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) (`aclImdb` folder with train/test splits).
- The notebook automatically loads and preprocesses this data for analysis and modeling.

## Project Structure
- `sentiment_analysis_movie_reviews.ipynb`: Main notebook with all code, explanations, and real-world IMDB data workflow.
- `aclImdb/`: Real-world movie reviews dataset (train/test splits, positive/negative labels).
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Professional Summary
Developed a complete data analytics and machine learning pipeline to preprocess, visualize, and classify movie review sentiments using Python and the IMDb dataset. Demonstrated skills in data cleaning, EDA, visualization, NLP, and model evaluation for real-world business applications.
